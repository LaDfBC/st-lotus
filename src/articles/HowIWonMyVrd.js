      <Typography paragraph>Rotisserie Drafts sound like they might grow old fast - a static card pool that is only marginally shaken up by most new sets and lacks the variety that the random contents of packs gives to normal booster draft. In practice, Vintage Rotisserie Draft has remained popular over the years and as soon as you try it you see why - it's a format of endless possibilities where the public information of the drafting process creates some fascinating dynamics. I've enjoyed dabbling in the format wherever I can (and just won the <Link href={link}>most recent Discord draft</Link>!) so here are some thoughts on how I would approach it with the competitive but creative mindset I apply to Constructed (bearing in mind that most VRDs in practice are a more relaxed affair where not all drafters have a cutthroat focus on maximizing their win rate).</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph><Link href="https://stlotus.org/build/index.html#/how-to-play">To summarize the format quickly</Link>: players take turns (this wraps around in 'snake order' - once the last player makes a pick in a round, they now pick again and the order reverses for this new round) to pick cards from the entire Vintage card pool. This isn't a formally organized format so each playgroup will have their own house rules for some of the edge cases (how to treat Snow-Covered basic lands, for example). After about 45 picks, players build and battle with their 40-card decks.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>With this turn order in mind, all seats are certainly not created equal. If the card pool has a few obvious power outliers (VRD has all the most powerful cards - there are enough of these that nobody walks away disappointed but also some easy picks for the first few seats) these will be snapped up by the early players in the first round. More importantly, the players at either ends of the wheel are at an advantage for the entire draft as they can make picks that are informed by each other without the risk of 'wasting' a pick on a card whose value has changed by the time you get to pick again.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>This is important context for my preferred approach to VRD: finding several specific combos or interactions to build around with high-quality card filtering and interaction tying the room together. You can stake your claim to one part of a combo knowing it's not worth it for any one opponent to waste their pick to steal the other part from you unless that part has other uses - for example, if you take <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/shm/257/painters-servant">Painter's Servant</Link> at any point it's very unlikely that someone will snatch your <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/tpr/223/grindstone">Grindstone</Link>, but the <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/uma/4/emrakul-the-aeons-torn">Emrakul, the Aeons Torn</Link> you want for your <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/145/sneak-attack">Sneak Attack</Link> might be nabbed by someone hoping to pair it with <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/157/channel">Channel</Link>. Reading the room and figuring out how long you can afford to leave a desired card or combo on the table to focus on cards you know will be fought over is a key to success in this format.</Typography>

        <Typography paragraph>The headliners of the Power 9 and guaranteed first-round picks in any VRD, these are the best cards in any deck lucky enough to have them but also change the value of other cards substantially. Adding a <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/6/mox-jet">Mox Jet</Link> to your card pool will help your win rate no matter what; adding <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/4/black-lotus">Black Lotus</Link> does the same but also allows you to build around the <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/4/black-lotus">Lotus</Link> for the rest of your draft. This can mean a lower bar for high-impact but expensive cards like <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/56/jace-the-mind-sculptor">Jace, the Mind Sculptor</Link>, specific synergies like <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/226/lurrus-of-the-dream-den">Lurrus</Link>/<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach">Underworld Breach</Link>/<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/91/emry-lurker-of-the-loch">Emry</Link>, or entire strategies like Storm or artifacts matter that can dream so much bigger when they have access to <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/4/black-lotus">Black Lotus</Link>.</Typography>
        <Typography>Similarly, opening the draft with <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/1/ancestral-recall">Ancestral Recall</Link> makes anything that copies or recasts spells much more appealing - including VRD and Constructed staples like <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/uma/71/snapcaster-mage">Snapcaster Mage</Link> and <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/war/125/dreadhorde-arcanist">Dreadhorde Arcanist</Link>. My winning deck from this VRD started with <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/2/time-walk">Time Walk</Link> intending to lean into it in one of several ways depending on what was open, ending up as a UR tempo deck that can convert close games to runaways quickly by finding <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/2/time-walk">Time Walk</Link> with <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/62/mystical-tutor">Mystical Tutor</Link>/<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/c21/119/dig-through-time">Dig Through Time</Link> and pairing it with <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ori/60/jace-vryns-prodigy-jace-telepath-unbound">Jace, Vryn's Prodigy</Link>/<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mid/224/galvanic-iteration">Galvanic Iteration</Link> or <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/227/lutri-the-spellchaser">Lutri</Link> as my companion.</Typography>

        <Typography><Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/287/time-vault">Time Vault</Link> is a frequent first-round pick as the best combo enabler around.

        <Typography >It's hard for a card to do more than <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/259/urzas-saga">Urza's Saga</Link> - it's several threats in one card that resists the most common forms of interaction and can find a combo piece, a hate card, or just grind the opponent down with even more card advantage.

        <Typography paragraph>Looming over the early rounds of every VRD is one question: when will the run on fetchlands start? As in other Eternal formats, fetchlands are excellent fixing in their own right and have all the small synergies that warp those formats in excess like delve and library manipulation but they have a unique flexibility in the context of a rotisserie draft - off-colour fixing of any other kind is useless for my UR deck but a <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ktk/249/wooded-foothills">Wooded Foothills</Link> or <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ktk/233/flooded-strand">Flooded Strand</Link> can still do great work for me if I pick up a dual/shockland/Triome to pair with it.</Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>This means there is naturally more competition over the fetchlands but also lessens the pressure to pick up any one in particular. My UR deck from the latest VRD couldn't enjoy <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/254/scalding-tarn">Scalding Tarn</Link> or <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/324/volcanic-island">Volcanic Island</Link> as the other URx drafter snapped those up first - but my <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ktk/249/wooded-foothills">Wooded Foothills</Link> and <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/grn/257/steam-vents">Steam Vents</Link> were effectively the same when I needed them to be.</Typography>
        <Typography >Taking this to its conclusion, <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/244/prismatic-vista">Prismatic Vista</Link> is the most valuable fetchland of all - it has all those added benefits while being automatically on-colour without needing to use another pick on a land.</Typography>

        <Typography paragraph>In every draft you have to strike a balance between filling out your own deck and having the right mix of maindeck/sideboard interaction to keep up with opponents trying to do their own absurd things. There's a steep drop between <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/109/thoughtseize">Thoughtseize</Link> and any other discard spell, making it crucial for any black drafter to take it highly and some very specialized tools like <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/147/red-elemental-blast">Red Elemental Blast</Link>/<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/142/pyroblast">Pyroblast</Link> don't have good replacements. On the other hand, a green drafter won't feel too bad about missing out on <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/164/force-of-vigor">Force of Vigor</Link> even if they agree it's the best of its kind because there's a bottomless well of <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/177/natures-claim">Nature's Claim</Link> variants to turn to if you like.</Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>This also informs the relative strengths/weaknesses of all the different proactive plans you can chase in this format. Many of the best strategies and multi-card packages revolve around artifacts but anyone can overload on artifact hate once you get to the later rounds and picking up sideboard cards is all that's left. In turn, this makes a generally stable deck or one that has several plans that don't share weaknesses more reliable than a deck too focused on one thing. An otherwise normal Azorius Control deck that happens to have a <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/287/time-vault">Time Vault</Link> or <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/shm/257/painters-servant">Painter</Link>-<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/tpr/223/grindstone">Grindstone</Link> combo presents a classic dilemma: how many cards that just tag artifacts do you even want, given that a hand with dead <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/m19/190/naturalize">Naturalizes</Link> is even more likely to lose to <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/phed/33/counterspell">Counterspell</Link> into <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/56/jace-the-mind-sculptor">Jace, the Mind Sculptor</Link>?</Typography>
        <Typography>This highlights a flaw in what seems like an obvious plan: draft a disruptive aggro deck in an open colour and have the platonic ideal of Mono-Red or Mono-White. This is a great recipe in Vintage Cube - why not try it here? The problem is that every colour and strategy can pick up as many anti-aggro tools as it likes and the structure of an aggro deck (requiring a high quantity of cards that apply early pressure) makes it tough to pivot into another strategy beyond the familiar Constructed method of raising your curve to become more of a midrange deck.</Typography>

      >My Draft</SubSectionHeader>
      <Typography paragraph>My draft from Dis7 shows off some of these principles as well as how much room there is to experiment!</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>P1 <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/2/time-walk">Time Walk</Link> - One of the most counterintuitive things about VRD is that <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/2/time-walk">Time Walk</Link> is generally seen as a second-tier card that doesn't belong with the headliners of the Power 9. I suspect this is a big mistake and that in a 'good <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/2/time-walk">Time Walk</Link> deck' having the card will massively increase your win rate when drawn - even more so if you try to build around it, which is why I knew I wanted it here. I hoped to pair it with <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/41/spellseeker">Spellseeker</Link>/<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mic/138/eternal-witness">Eternal Witness</Link>/<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/7/ephemerate">Ephemerate</Link> in a port of the Modern/Legacy deck if UGx was open or with <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mid/224/galvanic-iteration">Galvanic Iteration</Link> in UR otherwise.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>P2/3 <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/51/force-of-will">Force of Will</Link>/<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/52/force-of-negation">Force of Negation</Link> - The rare interaction that can consistently interact with fast combo starts while letting you develop your own plan at the same time.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>P4 <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/lrw/272/shelldock-isle">Shelldock Isle</Link> - A very early Isle to bridge the gap between some of the combo packages I was shooting for (<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/uma/4/emrakul-the-aeons-torn">Emrakul</Link> + cheat effects, <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/73/thassas-oracle">Thassa's Oracle</Link>) - even if I had ended up there, I could have picked this up much later instead.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>P7 <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/259/urzas-saga">Urza's Saga</Link> - I expect in a few months you won't ever get this card this late.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>P9/P2 <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/142/pyroblast">Pyroblast</Link>/<Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/147/red-elemental-blast">REB</Link> - Every VRD has several blue decks and those are usually the scariest competition - this draft was no exception. These would also be phenomenal against me and are the best answers to the top-shelf blue planeswalkers once they have resolved.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>P10 <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/227/lutri-the-spellchaser">Lutri</Link> - The closest thing to a free companion in VRD and good in context when I already plan to copy high-impact spells and want extra blue cards to pitch to my Forces.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>P13 <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/grn/257/steam-vents">Steam Vents</Link> - Many rounds after the run on fetches/duals, I'm able to pick up <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/grn/257/steam-vents">Steam Vents</Link> to level up my <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ktk/249/wooded-foothills">Foothills</Link> despite there being another UR drafter.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>P15 <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/ori/60/jace-vryns-prodigy-jace-telepath-unbound">Jace, Vryn's Prodigy</Link> - Will always play second fiddle to <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/uma/71/snapcaster-mage">Snapcaster Mage</Link> in VRD but it has a special upside in my deck - recasting the spell for no additional cost makes it easier to set up the copy + <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/vma/2/time-walk">Time Walk</Link> chains.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>P16 <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/52/murktide-regent">Murktide Regent</Link> - As in every format with MH2 there's now an urgent question - why would you bother with attackers in other colours when blue now has the best threat too?! Between this and the <Link href="https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/136/true-name-nemesis">True-Name Nemesis</Link> I gladly grabbed with P22 I have a threat base that rivals any dedicated creature deck as well as the unique strengths blue gets to boast about.</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>This was a rather conventional deck by my usual VRD standards and was diluted by directly competing with another streamlined UR tempo deck, but the card pool here is so deep that both of us were happy with our decks in the end.</Typography>
