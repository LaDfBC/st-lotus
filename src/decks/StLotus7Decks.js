This draft really showed the power of continuous board-control and prioritizing mana fixing incredibly early. Often we see combo decks get attempted in really high numbers, but the consistency of a bunch of planeswalkers, consistent mana, and good controlling elements got Brandon his first VRD win.'}</Typography>
